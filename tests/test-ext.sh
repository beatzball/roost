# --- the sandbox canary -----------------------------------------------------
# Copied in shape from tests/test-install.sh, which grew this after a test
# about a PATH line rewrote the developer's live agent config: one idiom for
# "a test must never touch the real user's homes," not a new one per file.
# AGENTS.md §8 names the full set that gets forgotten -- ZDOTDIR, the XDG
# pair, and the four harness homes (COPILOT_HOME, PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR,
# CODEX_HOME, CLAUDE_SETTINGS) -- and calls out that any of them left
# exported in the runner's own environment passes straight through a
# sandboxed HOME. Task 3 makes this concrete rather than defensive: the
# dispatcher execs extension binaries with an inherited environment, so this
# file has to be right about the whole set before that lands, not patched
# after it does.
#
# HOME is canaried here, unlike test-install.sh's copy: everything this file
# exercises today (--version) only READS, so nothing legitimately needs to
# write under $HOME, and pinning it turns a forgotten override into an empty
# directory under $TMP rather than the developer's real one. tests/test-doctor.sh
# made the same call for the same reason — see its header for the longer
# version of this argument.
#
# XDG_STATE_HOME is new to this pattern: no other test file canaries it,
# because no other file has anything under it to protect. This feature does —
# ext.lock, ext.index and every extension's data live there starting with a
# later task — so it is pinned from task 1 onward, before anything writes to
# it, rather than added the day something does.
